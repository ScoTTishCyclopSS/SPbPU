# Laboratory work No. 1-2

## Topic
Development of data structures for programs using classes. Development and debugging of programs demonstrating polymorphism.

## Task
You are required to describe a base class (possibly abstract) and 1-3 inherited classes. Each class to be developed must contain: hidden fields, constructors, properties, methods (or overloaded methods). Each class to be developed contains: hidden fields, constructors, simple or virtual methods. The Main function must contain an array of base class elements elements of the base class filled with references to the base and (or) derived classes. To fulfill the task at hand, it may be necessary to describe one or more properties to to get or set field values. Direct access to the fields is prohibited, because they have access level private.

## Variant 6
Create a base class Note (record) containing the fields: Person's full name, phone number. Create a derived class Friend containing additional fields: e-mail, date of birth (an array of three numbers). Describe methods for displaying records on the screen, getting and setting values of some fields. Organize the display of information from the array about all friends born in the specified month (if there are no such friends, then display the corresponding message).
