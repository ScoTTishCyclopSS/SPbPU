# Laboratory work No. 12

## Topic
Developing a class on working with binary files of data objects

## Task 1
The program should write to a binary file the data entered by the user, thus forming a simple database. To enter some data fields apply the component "combined list", for numeric data of a small range in some cases you can use a value switch. Output data from the file using a second form, where the contents of the file should be displayed in a table.

## Task 2
In addition to outputting the entire contents of the entire file, in the same table on the second form, output the results of the query (selected records) according to your assignment.

## Variant 2 
Create a data structure (class) for a weather observation station that has the following fields: date, time, air temperature, wind speed, wind direction. 
Develop the following functions: 
- adding objects to the file
- displaying the contents of the entire file
- correcting an individual record found by the contents of the main field
- selecting records by the contents of one of the fields and displaying the found records

The program interface is designed as a menu.
