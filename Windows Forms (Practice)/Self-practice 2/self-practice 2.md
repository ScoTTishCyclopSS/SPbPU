# Self-practice 2

## Topic
Using subroutines to process simple data types

## Task
Develop a program that demonstrates the creation and use of your own function. The function should receive input data through parameters, calculate the result according to the task and pass it to the place of call. A function with a result passes one calculated value (result) through the return operator. A function can also pass several results through parameters-variables.

## Variant 6. 
1. Develop a function that allows recognizing palindromes ("inverts"), i.e. numbers whose decimal notation is read equally from left to right and from right to left
2. Two natural multi-digit numbers are given. Find out whether at least one of them is a palindrome
